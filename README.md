# Word Game

This project is part of the [Joy of React course](https://www.joyofreact.com/) by Josh Comeau.

You can see it running live [here](https://project-wordle-indol.vercel.app/)

## Learnings

While following the lessons and working on this course I brushed up on skills like 
- Managing state locally
- Deciding when to create new components
- Conditionally rendering components and applying css classes
- Deploying static react to vercel


### Deployment

With the vercel client installed, deploying is as easy as running `vercel`


## Joy of React, Project I

In this project, we'll recreate a popular online word game, Wordle:

![Demo showing the finished product, our Wordle clone](docs/wordle-demo.gif)

In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.
